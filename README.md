## Legacy Website     https://cortanium.net/legacywebsite.v2

This is the revised version of my old website. 

If you want to see my new one, go [here](https://github.com/cortanium/cortanium.github.io)!


## Revision

  - Everything is formatted to standards!

  - Deleted comments, Google API, and unneccesary code.

  - JQuery CDN provides CSS, JS, and fonts

All in all, it's a little bit faster, smaller, and definitely easier to read. Have fun poking through the code, if you want to! :)
